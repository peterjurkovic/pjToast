        <p>
            pjToast is a simple Angular module for toast notifications. This Toast notification is inspired by
            <strong><a href="http://tamerayd.in/ngToast/" target="_blank">ngToast</a></strong> with following significant differences:
        </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The notification message is positioned absolute (to the center of screen)</li>
        <li>Only one message is shown in given time (other additional messages are in the queue)</li>
    </ul>

<div class="container">
    <button ng-click="successToast()" type="button" class="btn btn-success">Success Toast message</button>
</div>
<br />
<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-javascript">
